		"subtitle": "Haystack 2.x is a major update to the design of Haystack components, Document Stores, and pipelines. Based on the online doc, they believe that the pipeline concept is a fundamental requirement and an optimal fit for building applications with LLMs. There are many changes that being implemented from 1.x to 2.x version. They add more flexibility in creating pipeline, metadata, document store, and component.",

Unlike linear sequences, LangGraph’s graph architecture allows branching, conditional steps, and even feedback loops within the workflow. This results in more versatile, efficient applications, where LLM interactions can adapt based on previous results or user interactions.",
